Adversary emulation plans (AEPs) are the way to model adversary behavior based on a particular set of TTPs in MITRE ATT&CK. For example, MITRE has created an AEP for APT3 to showcase exactly how APT3 compromises a system and exfiltrates sensitive information. Security teams use AEPs to create attack simulations based on specific adversaries to test their defense. 

Though AEPs are especially important when testing and building a strong defense, they are often overlooked for TTPs by security practitioners versed in the “trench warfare” of day-to-day security operations. Though TTPs are useful in their own right, they are much more effective when coupled with AEPs.

In fact, OS Controls team finds that AEPs are the most important feature when constructing an effective operational security effort tailored to your business. While TTPs may change, the general process of bringing TTPs together into a real-world attack simulation whose efficacy can be measured is the real gem. AEPs bring TTPs into a measurable attack simulation based on a specific, real-world adversary for specific, real-world improvements.
Using AEPs in the Real World: Attack Simulations

Red teams can use AEPs to develop an attack simulation and execute it against enterprise security infrastructure. These simulations leverage real-world attacks so you can identify and tune gaps in your defense before the actual adversary strikes. They also help reduce your security team load and give them greater visibility into their environment. 

For the most significant results, turn this process into a monthly or yearly activity to consistently strengthen and tune your defense over time. 
Building an AEP

AEPs are made up of several sections, including an overview of the plan, an overview of the adversary group, a detailed listing of the emulation phases, and a biography of sources.
