“Operational Technology” OT devices are focused on networks, systems, controllers that manage and control the common building devices people take for granted on a daily basis, Like networks that control your Elevators, lighting, HVAC, sensors, Data center controls - all of these systems are controlled by “PLC’s” Programable logic controllers – and in turn are managed via a “SCADA” system. 

Our Audit service specializes in OT, IT, IoT, vOT, related device discovery - which does encompass Iot Internet of things (those devices with very little to no security) and their discovery, assessment and remediation.

OS.Control assessment and remediation audit services, We have several Tools, Techniques and Procedures to discover the – undiscoverable.   We have multiple ways to engage on the discovery of these devices, including a specialized tool called (OSde) a collector that locates and profiles devices.

The most thorough discovery method is the OSde device and our onsite team. This discovery process can take well over a month, depending on firewalls, segmentation (vlan acl’s, private vlans, vpns, mpls, etc) either-way it’s all discoverable, and we can find it.

After the discovery and mapping phase; We review all the telemetry, components, functionality, placement, requirement to continue its use, replacement of components where prudent. Then we work with you and your team to develop a remediation plan. We can develop a custom remediation plan, however we find it better to collaborate with the network owners. Our remediation efforts start with the highest vulnerable devices, whether that involves (private vlans, ACL’s, Firewalls, AirGap) and/or the OCS hardened ICS Firewall (similar to the Cisco ASA) that we can use to secure and monitor the -insecure-able IoT and OT devices.
